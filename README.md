# antlr4-cli

A simple NPM wrapper for the antlr4 parser/lexer generator tool, to allow the dependency to be managed by NPM.

Note that the NPM package version relays the version of antlr4 being used, for easy dependency viewing. Accepts all antlr4 command line options, since it just forwards them along to the `.jar`.
